## Overview

NSW Drivers Test is a web application that helps learner drivers find the earliest available driving test appointments across all Service NSW locations. Instead of manually checking each location, this tool aggregates availability data and sorts locations by distance from your chosen address/location.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust** - Core application logic with strong safety guarantees
- **Tokio** - Asynchronous runtime for efficient concurrent operations
- **Leptos** - Fast, reactive web framework that compiles to WebAssembly
- **Serde** - Serialization/deserialization framework
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API** - Geocoding for location-based searches
- **WebAssembly** - For client-side processing of location data
- **Tailwind CSS** - For responsive, modern UI design

## Features

- **Location Search**: Find Service NSW centers by address, suburb, or postcode
- **Distance Calculation**: View centers ordered by distance from your location
- **Availability Tracking**: See the earliest available test slot for each location
- **Auto Refresh**: Data automatically refreshes to keep information current
- **Privacy-focused**: Location searches processed locally in your browser
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **No Login Required**: No Service NSW credentials needed to view availability
